<h1 id="external-features">External Features</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The outside of a church and the surrounding churchyard typically
contain many interesting features, as well as being a haven for
wildlife.</p>
<h2 id="lychgate">Lychgate</h2>
<p>Lych is derived from the Old English ‘lich’, meaning corpse. They
were meeting places and shelters for the party bringing a corpse for
burial, and for the priest to receive the corpse.</p>
<p>Although some had been built earlier, the 1549 Prayer Book required
the priest to meet the corpse at the churchyard entrance. This
encouraged the provision of lychgates to shelter the corpse and the
funeral party for that purpose.</p>
<p>Medieval lychgates were made of timber and most have long since
disappeared. However, many new lychgates were erected in Victorian
times, sometimes as memorials to prominent local people or as war
memorials.</p>
<h2 id="churchyard">Churchyard</h2>
<h2 id="yew-trees">Yew Trees</h2>
<h2 id="churchyard-path">Churchyard Path</h2>
<h2 id="preaching-and-churchyard-cross">Preaching and Churchyard
Cross</h2>
<h2 id="tower-or-spire">Tower or Spire</h2>
<h2 id="carillon">Carillon</h2>
<h2 id="buttress">Buttress</h2>
<h2 id="niche">Niche</h2>
<p>Most ancient churches have a niche, usually on or near the porch,
where a statue of the church’s patron saint was displayed. Today, often
they are empty.</p>
<h2 id="dripstone">Dripstone</h2>
<p>A dripstone is a projecting stone moulding over doorways, windows and
archways. It was designed to throw off rainwater and prevent it from
running down tracery and glass.</p>
<p>It was also used for ornament and sometimes heads, grotesques or
other ornamentations are carved at either end of the dripstone.</p>
<h2 id="gargoyle">Gargoyle</h2>
<p>The word gargoyle derives from the Old French ‘gargouille’, meaning
throat.</p>
<p>A gargoyle is a projecting waterspout, usually incorporating a lead
pipe. They were often carved in the shape of grotesque faces, beasts or
figures. Gargoyles appear to have been first introduced around 1200.</p>
<p>Celtic warriors were known to chop off the heads of defeated enemies
and display them in public. This may account for the popularity of
gargoyles.</p>
<h2 id="sundial">Sundial</h2>
<p>Most medieval churches have a sundial.</p>
<p>It is usually situated above the porch or on the south face of the
tower. Its main purpose was to ensure that the bell was rung at the
correct time to mark daytime canonical hours. In many places, the
sundial was the only reliable public timepiece until the early 19th
century.</p>
<p>Eventually sundials developed into church clocks.</p>
<h2 id="scratch-dial">Scratch Dial</h2>
<p>Also known as Mass Dials, these were a very early and primitive form
of sun dial. They were used by priests to advertise the time of the next
service.</p>
<p>Usually in the form of a semi circle about ten inches across, they
were scratched into the south wall of the church. A hole was bored at
the centre and a number of lines scratched from the hole to the arc. The
priest would place a short stick in the hole and when the sun shone the
shadow of the stick on to one of the lines, the next service would
start.</p>
<h2 id="devils-door">Devil’s Door</h2>
<p>The Devil’s door was in the north wall of the church.</p>
<p>This door was traditionally left open during a baptism to let out any
evil spirits in the child. Following the reformation, many devils doors
were removed or blocked up.</p>
<h2 id="corbel-table-stones">Corbel Table / Stones</h2>
<p>Corbel stones are projections of stone, brick or wood designed to
support an arch or beam.</p>
<p>A corbel table is a series of corbels immediately below the roof
eaves, and can be found both externally and internally. The Normans were
especially fond of corbel tables, which were often elaborately carved in
the form of monsters and other grotesque creatures.</p>
<h2 id="mounting-block">Mounting Block</h2>
<p>A mounting block gives assistance when mounting and dismounting
horses. They are frequently located outside churches for the use of
parishioners attending services.</p>
<p>They may have iron rings nearby for the horse’s reins to be tethered
to whilst its owner was in church.</p>
<h2 id="holy-water-stoup">Holy Water Stoup</h2>
<p>A stoup is a receptacle for holding holy water.</p>
<p>It is usually in the form of a small stone basin, in the porch near
to the church door. People about to enter the church would dip their
index finger in the water and make the sign of the cross upon
themselves.</p>
<p>This practice was stopped following the Reformation and many of the
stoups were removed.</p>
