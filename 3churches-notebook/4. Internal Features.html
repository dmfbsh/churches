<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Churches contain many interesting, historical and valuable features
and artefacts with artwork and symbolism relating to the spiritual life
of the church. The features and artifacts to look out for are itemised
on this page.</p>
<h2 id="altar">Altar</h2>
<p>The altar is the heart of the church. It usually stands at the east
end of the chancel or presbytery, in an area known as the sanctuary. The
altar has two principal symbolic meanings. First, it is a sacrificial
altar. Christian writers saw Jesus as a sacrificed lamb in his
crucifixion and the altar remembers that sacrifice. Second, it is a
table for a communal meal, remembering the last supper. The altar is
frequently marked by five crosses, referring to the five wounds of
Christ.</p>

<h2 id="altar-rail">Altar Rail</h2>
<p>The altar rail (also known as a communion rail or chancel rail) is a
low barrier, sometimes ornate and usually made of stone, wood or metal
in some combination, delimiting the chancel and the sanctuary.</p>
<p>One theory is that communion rails came into use for the very
practical purpose of keeping dogs and other stray animals away from the
altar area, at a time when bringing such animals into the church would
not have been uncommon.</p>

<h2 id="aumbry">Aumbry</h2>
<p>An aumbry is a small, secure chest or cupboard in a wall, usually the
north wall near to the altar. It houses the sacred vessels used during
the service and communion. Today, aumbries are often used to store the
Blessed Sacrament.</p>

<h2 id="bells">Bells</h2>
<p>A church bell in Christian architecture is a bell which is rung in a
church for a variety of religious purposes, and can be heard outside the
building. Traditionally they are used to call worshippers to the church
for a communal service, and to announce the fixed times of daily
Christian prayer, called the canonical <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
hours, which number seven and are contained in breviaries. They are also
rung on special occasions such as a wedding, or a funeral service. In
some religious traditions they are used within the liturgy of the church
service to signify to people that a particular part of the service has
been reached. The ringing of church bells, in the Christian tradition,
is also believed to drive out demons.</p>
<p>The traditional European church bell used in Christian churches
worldwide consists of a cup-shaped metal resonator with a pivoted
clapper hanging inside which strikes the sides when the bell is swung.
It is hung within a steeple or belltower of a church or religious
building, so the sound can reach a wide area. Such bells are either
fixed in position (“hung dead”) or hung from a pivoted beam (the
“headstock”) so they can swing to and fro. A rope hangs from a lever or
wheel attached to the headstock, and when the bell ringer pulls on the
rope the bell swings back and forth and the clapper hits the inside,
sounding the bell. Bells that are hung dead are normally sounded by
hitting the sound bow with a hammer or occasionally by a rope which
pulls the internal clapper against the bell.</p>
<p>A church may have a single bell, or a collection of bells which are
tuned to a common scale. They may be stationary and chimed, rung
randomly by swinging through a small arc, or swung through a full circle
to enable the high degree of control of English change ringing.</p>
<p>Before modern communications, church bells were a common way to call
the community together for all purposes, both sacred and secular.</p>

<h2 id="chained-bible">Chained Bible</h2>
<p>King Henry VIII declared that a large copy of the English Bible
should be set up on a lectern in every parish church in England, so that
the poor as well as the rich might hear the Word of the Lord.</p>
<p>To guard against theft, the bibles were chained securely.</p>

<h2 id="easter-sepulchre">Easter Sepulchre</h2>
<p>Easter is the most important festival of the Christian year. An
Easter sepulchre is an arched recess, usually in the north wall of the
sanctuary. It is used during the annual Easter ceremonies as it is
symbolic of Jesus’ burial in the tomb following the crucifixion.</p>
<p>A crucifix and other sacred elements were placed in the sepulchre
from Good Friday until Easter Day. The sepulchre was generally set into
the north wall of the chancel. Such sepulchres often resemble canopied
tombs, with elaborate carved frontals and highly decorative canopies.
Easter Sepulchres are found only in England, and generally date from the
Decorated Gothic period, roughly 13th and 14th centuries.</p>
<p>Easter Sepulchres are relatively rare, as most were destroyed during
the Reformation. In some cases elaborate tombs are identified as
possible sepulchres but such identification is impossible to verify,
especially in cases where the carving is worn or partially
destroyed.</p>

<h2 id="font">Font</h2>
<p>Every medieval church contained a font. It was close to the main
entrance of the church in an area known as the baptistry. The font is
placed by the entrance as it symbolises the start of a new life as a
Christian. Baptism represents leaving behind the past and committing to
God for the future. Today, fonts may be found elsewhere in the
church.</p>
<p>The word font is derived from the Latin word ‘fons’ which means
spring.</p>
<p>The font contains the holy water used in Baptism. They were
originally large enough to allow the infant to be fully immersed, but in
the middle ages it became the practice to baptise by partial immersion
or pouring water over the head.</p>
<p>In 1236 it was ordered that all fonts should have a lockable lid to
prevent the theft of the holy water.</p>

<h2 id="great-rood">Great Rood</h2>
<p>A rood is a carved image of Christ on the cross, made of wood or
stone. The medieval ‘great rood’ was a carved and painted crucifix,
erected on a pedestal above the rood screen. It had the figures of the
Blessed Virgin Mary and St John the Evangelist on either side of Jesus
on the cross.</p>

<h2 id="green-man">Green Man</h2>
<p>The Green Man is one of the most powerful and enduring pagan symbols
and was originally a Celtic fertility symbol.</p>
<p>Green Men are found in a variety of forms in the ornamental stonework
and woodwork of churches. They are male heads peering through foliage,
which is often growing from their eyes, mouth, ears and nostrils. They
are usually found on roof bosses, capitals, corbels and misericords.</p>

<p>A hatchment is a diamond-shaped board made of wood or wood and
canvas.</p>
<p>It bears the arms, crest or motto of a deceased person.</p>
<p>Hatchments were carried in front of funeral processions to the
church, and afterwards hung on the gate of the deceased person’s house.
After it had been hung on the gates for several months, it was taken
down and hung in the church.</p>

<h2 id="instruments-of-christs-passion">Instruments of Christ’s
Passion</h2>
<p>Representations of the Instruments of Christ’s Passion are displayed
in many churches, with the object of remembering Christ’s suffering for
the redemption of mankind. These can be in stained glass windows, on
roof bosses, on reredos screens, or painted onto a number of small
shields. Instruments shown include the cross, the crown of thorns,
lances, hammer and nails, scourges, and the robe which Christ wore.</p>
<h2 id="kneeler">Kneeler</h2>
<p>A kneeler is a cushion (also called a tuffet or hassock) or a piece
of furniture used for resting in a kneeling position during Christian
prayer.</p>
<p>In many churches, pews are equipped with kneelers in front of the
seating bench so members of the congregation can kneel on them instead
of the floor. In a few other situations, such as confessionals and areas
in front of an altar, kneelers for kneeling during prayer or sacraments
may also be used. Traditionally, altar rails often have built-in knee
cushions to facilitate reception of Holy Communion while kneeling.</p>
<p>Kneelers in churches are a modern development. Kneeling was not part
of the Mass in early Christianity, and has been part of the Catholic
Mass only since the 16th century.</p>

<h2 id="lectern">Lectern</h2>
<p>The lectern is a reading desk on which the bible rests.</p>
<p>It is usually made from brass or wood, and is moveable. Brass
lecterns are usually in the shape of an eagle with outstretched wings.
The eagle often stands on a ball which represents the world, while the
bible on the eagle’s back symbolises the gospel being carried to the
corners of the earth.</p>

<h2 id="memorials">Memorials</h2>
<p>The ‘great and good’ of society enjoyed the privilege of being
commemorated within their parish churches. It should be remembered that
monuments do not necessarily mark the place of interment, which may be
some distance away.</p>
<p>Monuments can provide a wealth of information concerning those
remembered; wealth, fashion, their appearance, the way people lived, and
how they hoped to be remembered. Memorials vary in size from large,
elaborate, canopied monuments to modest tablets fixed to the church
wall. From the beginning of the 13th century the image was often placed
on a tomb chest and carved in the form of a three dimensional
effigy.</p>

<p>Some church stalls have misericords. They are hinged, tip up wooden
seats which, when up, have a second smaller seat on the underside for
the user to rest on when standing position. Sometimes the misericord
seat has carved decorations.</p>

<h2 id="organ">Organ</h2>
<p>The pipe organ is one of the oldest of all instruments and may
pre-date Christianity by around 1000 years or so. It wasn’t until around
900AD that we find organs being used for church worship and exactly how
or why is unclear, however, it was probably for ceremonial purposes
initially. By the 1400’s organs appear to be well established in
monastic churches and cathedrals throughout Europe.</p>

<h2 id="parish-chest">Parish Chest</h2>
<p>For hundreds of years, large chests with slots in the top were used
for the collecting alms. Chests were also used for keeping parish
registers, accounts, and other records.</p>
<p>They usually had three or more locks, each with a separate key held
by a different person. All had to be present to unlock the chest.</p>

<h2 id="piscina">Piscina</h2>
<p>The Latin word ‘piscina’ literally means fish pond.</p>
<p>The piscina is a niche containing a shallow stone basin with a drain
hole. It was used for disposing of the holy water used to wash the
communion vessels during the service. A double piscina also has a bowl
for the priest to wash his hands.</p>

<h2 id="pulpit">Pulpit</h2>
<p>A pulpit is a raised stand for preachers in a Christian church. The
origin of the word is the Latin pulpitum (platform or staging). The
oldest mention of a pulpit in England dates from the 12th century. The
oldest example still in existence is believed to date from about 1330.
In the 15th century, only a fifth of churches had a pulpit, but in 1603
they were made compulsory.</p>

<h2 id="rood-loft">Rood Loft</h2>
<p>Many medieval churches had a rood loft, or singing gallery, on top of
the rood screen. It was often supported by a coving. In most cases the
only evidence left that these existed are the blocked up doorways that
led to them.</p>
<h2 id="rood-screen">Rood Screen</h2>
<p>In medieval churches, the rood screen was a decorative stone or
wooden screen which separated the nave from the chancel, and had a
central gate. Most were pierced with a lattice work of carved wood and
richly decorated. Other screens were used to separate chapels from the
chancel or aisles.</p>

<h2 id="roof-boss">Roof Boss</h2>
<p>A boss is a decoration in stone or wood where cross members of a roof
or ceiling intersect. Many are elaborately carved, and popular subjects
include grotesque and human faces, green men, symbols of Christ’s
passion, heraldic shields, foliage and animals. For most of them, the
original paintwork has long since gone, to be replaced in some cases by
a covering of gilt paint.</p>
<h2 id="royal-coats-of-arms">Royal Coats of Arms</h2>
<p>After the Pope granted Henry VIII the title ‘Defender of the Faith’,
Royal coats of arms of the king or queen of the day were hung in
churches. They were there to remind congregations of the link between
the church and the state.</p>

<h2 id="seating">Seating</h2>
<p>For centuries there was no seating in the nave, although a stone
ledge was sometimes provided for the elderly and infirm; ‘the weakest go
to the wall’.</p>
<p>With the increase in preaching came the need for seating. By the late
16th century an increasing number of churches had installed permanent
benches.</p>
<p>Rows of benches are often erroneously referred to as pews. Pews are
actually enclosed structures, and of a much later date and had doors to
protect from drafts. These ‘box pews’ were sometimes provided with
armchairs and cushions and perhaps even a stove and curtains.</p>

<h2 id="sedilia">Sedilia</h2>
<p>These are recessed seats, usually three, for priests. They are
usually set into the south wall of the chancel, are made of stone and
may be canopied.</p>

<h2 id="stained-glass">Stained Glass</h2>
<p>Stained glass is used to add beauty and colour to churches. Often
windows show biblical scenes.</p>
<p>Most medieval stained glass was lost following the Reformation and
during the Civil War, when it was smashed by the iconoclasts <a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>There was a revival of interest in stained glass during the Victorian
era, and much of what we see today is from that time. Victorian stained
glass was usually installed as a memorial to local people or to
commemorate significant events.</p>

<h2 id="stations-of-the-cross">Stations of the Cross</h2>
<p>Sometimes depicted in a series of paintings or carvings round the
walls of a church. They represent the fourteen incidents which occurred
in Christ’s last journey from His meeting with Pilate to His entombment.
During a devotion of the same name, each station is visited in turn.</p>
<h2 id="tabernacle">Tabernacle</h2>
<p>For those Christian traditions which practice the rite known as
Eucharist or Holy Communion, a tabernacle or sacrament house is a fixed,
locked box in which the Eucharist (consecrated communion hosts) is
stored as part of the “reserved sacrament” rite. A container for the
same purpose, which is set directly into a wall, is called an
aumbry.</p>
<h2 id="wall-painting">Wall Painting</h2>
<p>In the middle ages, the interior walls of churches were like picture
books of painted plaster. They were used as visual aids for the
illiterate congregation. Walls were covered with murals depicting saints
and scenes from the scriptures.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>In the practice of Christianity, canonical hours mark
the divisions of the day in terms of fixed times of prayer at regular
intervals. A book of hours (The book of hours is a Christian devotional
book popular in the Middle Ages. It is the most common type of surviving
medieval illuminated manuscript. Like every manuscript, each manuscript
book of hours is unique in one way or another, but most contain a
similar collection of texts, prayers and psalms, often with appropriate
decorations, for Christian devotion.), chiefly a breviary (A breviary
(Latin: breviarium) is a liturgical book used in Christianity for
praying the canonical hours, usually recited at seven fixed prayer
times.), normally contains a version of, or selection from, such
prayers. In Anglicanism, they are often known as the daily or divine
office, to distinguish them from the other ‘offices’ of the Church (holy
communion, baptism, etc.), which are commonly observed weekly or less
often.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn2"><p>Iconoclasm is the social belief in the importance of the
destruction of icons and other images or monuments, most frequently for
religious or political reasons. People who engage in or support
iconoclasm are called iconoclasts, a term that has come to be
figuratively applied to any individual who challenges cherished beliefs
or venerated institutions on the grounds that they are erroneous or
pernicious.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
