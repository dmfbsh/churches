<p>Anglicanism is a Western Christian tradition that has developed from
the practices, liturgy, and identity of the Church of England following
the English Reformation, in the context of the Protestant Reformation in
Europe.</p>
<h1 id="diocese">Diocese</h1>
<p>Also known as a Bishopric, a diocese is an ecclesiastical district
under the jurisdiction of a bishop.</p>
<p>Shropshire is covered by two diocese - Lichfield and Hereford. The
split is very roughly equivalent to the north and south of the county
and broadly aligns with the old kingdoms of Wreocansaete and
Magonsæte.</p>
<p>Both of Shropshire’s diocese are part of the province of
Canterbury.</p>
<p>A suffragan bishop is a bishop appointed to help a diocesan bishop,
of which there are two in Shropshire.</p>
<p>The Anglican Bishop of Shrewsbury is an episcopal title used by a
suffragan bishop of the Church of England Diocese of Lichfield, in the
Province of Canterbury, England. The title takes its name after the town
of Shrewsbury in Shropshire and was first created under the Suffragan
Bishops Act 1534.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Ludlow was an episcopal title used by a suffragan
bishop of the Church of England Diocese of Hereford, which is within the
Province of Canterbury, England. The See (the area of a bishop’s
ecclesiastical jurisdiction) of Ludlow was created under the Suffragans
Nomination Act 1888 by Order in Council dated 23 September 1981and was
the only suffragan see in the Diocese of Hereford.</p>
<h1 id="archdeaconry">Archdeaconry</h1>
<p>In Shropshire there are two archdeanerys, one for each diocese
covering the county.</p>
<p>The original Shropshire archdeaconry in the Hereford diocese included
the deaneries of Burford, Stottesdon, Ludlow, Pontesbury, Clun and
Wenlock. On 4th April 1876, the archdeaconry of Shropshire became the
archdeaconry of Ludlow, with the additional deaneries of Bridgnorth
(added in 1535), Montgomery, Bishops Castle, Condover, and Church
Stretton.</p>
<p>The archdeaconry of Salop, now entirely in the Lichfield diocese,
includes the deaneries of Edgmond, Ellesmere, Hodnet, Shrewsbury,
Telford, Wem, Whitchurch and Wrockwardine. Part of Welsh Shropshire was
included in the diocese of St Asaph until the disestablishment of the
Church in Wales (1920), which included the deanery of Oswestry in the
archdeaconry of Montgomery.</p>
<p>An archdeacon is a senior member the clergy who serves the dioceses’
bishop. An archdeacon is usually responsible for the archdeaconry’s
buildings and the pastoral care of the clergy within the
archdeaconry.</p>
<h1 id="deanery">Deanery</h1>
<p>A deanery is a group of parishes forming a district within an
archdeaconry. The more formal term, rural deanery, is less often used,
though the superintendent of a deanery is the Rural Dean. Rural
deaneries are very ancient and originally corresponded with the
hundreds. The title “dean” (Latin decanus) may derive from the custom of
dividing a hundred into ten tithings. In medieval times rural deans
acted as officers of the diocesan bishop, but archdeacons gradually took
over most of their duties. However, the office was revived during the
19th century.</p>
<h1 id="parish">Parish</h1>
<p>A parish is a territorial entity in many Christian denominations,
constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral
care and clerical jurisdiction of a priest, often termed a parish
priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates
from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same
geographical area as a manor. Its association with the parish church
remains paramount.</p>
