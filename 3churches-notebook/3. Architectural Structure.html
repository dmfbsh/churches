<h1 id="architectural-structure">Architectural Structure</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The earliest Christians worshipped in private houses, often in
secret. With the victory of the Roman emperor Constantine at the Battle
of Milvian Bridge in 312 AD, Christianity became a lawful and then the
privileged religion of the Roman Empire. With the religion lawful,
Christian architecture was made to correspond to civic and imperial
forms, and so the Basilica, a large rectangular meeting hall (with a
nave and aisles and sometimes galleries and clerestories), became the
model for churches. While civic basilicas had apses at either end, the
Christian basilica usually had a single apse where the bishop and
presbyters sat in a dais behind the altar. While pagan basilicas had as
their focus a statue of the emperor, Christian basilicas focused on the
Eucharist as the symbol of the eternal, loving and forgiving God. The
first very large Christian churches, were built in Rome in the early 4th
century. Since then, the plan of a church has essentially remained the
same.</p>

<h2 id="direction">Direction</h2>
<p>Churches are always oriented east to west with the chancel, sanctuary
and altar in the east. This is because the east faces towards the holy
city of Jerusalem which is where, in medieval writing, God’s presence
was said to be strongest. It also links to the Christian story of Jesus
rising from the dead at sunrise on Easter day. The window in the east
end of the building also lets in the rising sun symbolising God as the
light of the world. Although this would also serve the practical
function of lighting up a dark church in medieval times when candles
were less common and electricity didn’t exist.</p>
<p>The church at Ironbridge (St Luke) is an exception to this because
the land at the west end would not support the tower.</p>
<h2 id="shape">Shape</h2>
<p>Churches are most often built in a cruciform shape (cross shaped).
The reasoning for this is simple – the cross represents the cross in
Christian teachings.</p>
<h2 id="tower">Tower</h2>
<p>The church tower is the part of the church which dominates the
landscape. The tower is often situated at the west end of the nave. In
some churches the tower is situated in the centre above the crossing.
Church towers have many styles and designs, and some include spires.</p>
<p>The church tower has many functions, the primary purpose being to
denote the location of the church. Most towers contain bells which
provide direct and audible communication between the church and the
parish, church towers have other functions. Some towers were built as
lanterns to allow light into the body of the church, whereas others
maintained a light to provide direction for night-time travel. Saxon or
Norman towers were also built as accommodation and refuge in times of
unrest. After the Norman Conquest numerous towers were built onto
churches, these were often massive, like towers on contemporary castles,
and where there is an absence of a west doorway this may indicate a
defensive structure.</p>
<h2 id="narthex">Narthex</h2>
<p>A narthex is either an outside, covered porch-like structure or an
inside area separated from the nave by a screen, but over time this word
has also come to mean “entry” or “foyer”. It is always at the West end
of the church. Traditionally the narthex was a part of the church
building, but was not considered part of the church proper, as it is
where those not eligible for admittance into the general congregation
(particularly catechumens<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and penitents <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>)
could hear and partake of the service.</p>
<h2 id="porch">Porch</h2>
<p>Ancient churches usually stand to the north of the original village,
and so the south door is the main entrance. In the Middle Ages many
ceremonies took place at the church door, including parts of the baptism
and marriage services. Schooling, penance, the churching of women and
the coroners court also took place at the church door. Typically, it was
not until the 14th Century that porches were constructed to give shelter
(usually at the south door).</p>
<p>Some of the finest medieval porches in Shropshire can be seen at
Munslow and Billingsley.</p>
<h2 id="baptistry">Baptistry</h2>
<p>The baptistry is a separate, transitional space used by those who are
not yet members of the church. In most churches the baptistry is the
area close the narthex where the font is located, at the west end of the
nave.</p>
<h2 id="nave">Nave</h2>
<p>Derived from the Latin word ‘navis’, meaning ship. It was thought
that the nave roof resembled an upside down ship, or the Ark of
Salvation.</p>
<p>The nave is the main body of the church. Originally, the nave was
unconsecrated and its maintenance was the responsibility of the
congregation. In the early days of the church, the nave was used for
many functions: it was the scene of trial by ordeal <a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>,
storage space for the arms which every parish had to provide (the
regimental colours found in many churches are a reminder of this) and a
venue for guild plays, processions, church ales <a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> and
business.</p>
<p>Churches had a stone bench set into the side walls so that old and
infirm people could sit down. This is where the saying ‘the weakest go
to the wall’ comes from.</p>
<p>Bench style seating was introduced into churches after the
Reformation when the preaching of very long sermons became a major part
of the services and people needed to be able to sit down.</p>
<h2 id="arcade">Arcade</h2>
<p>An arcade is a range of arches supported on piers or columns. The
term is also used to describe the arched division between the nave of a
church and its aisles.</p>
<h2 id="aisle">Aisle</h2>
<p>The word aisle comes from the Latin ‘ala’ meaning wing.</p>
<p>An aisle is a sideways extension of a nave, from which it is divided
by an arcade of arches. Some churches were built with aisles, but they
were usually added to earlier buildings, perhaps to accommodate the
growing population.</p>
<h2 id="clerestory">Clerestory</h2>
<p>A clerestory is a high section of wall that contains windows above
eye level.</p>
<p>In architecture, a clerestory, is a high section of wall that
contains windows above eye level. The purpose is to admit light, fresh
air, or both.</p>
<p>In larger churches, the upper level of the nave wall was often
pierced by windows to increase the amount of light entering the church.
When aisles were added in medieval times, many churches raised the nave
wall, so that a clerestory could be installed.</p>
<h2 id="columns">Columns</h2>
<p>Arcades rest on columns.</p>
<p>The first columns would have been made of wood. They are like trees
and remind us of ancient pagan beliefs and practices.</p>
<p>Capitals, the top part of columns, are often carved with leaves or
other similar decorations, reinforcing the connection with trees.</p>
<h2 id="gallery">Gallery</h2>
<p>A gallery is an upper storey constructed to provide additional
seating for the church.</p>
<p>Side galleries, to the north and south of the nave, were erected in
many churches in the 18th and early 19th centuries to accommodate the
greatly increasing population of the industrial revolution, and later
taken down when church congregations began to decrease.</p>
<p>Many churches also have west galleries, in the space beneath the
tower, which were intended to accommodate choirs and musicians. Later,
church organs were often placed in the west gallery.</p>
<h2 id="transept">Transept</h2>
<p>A transept is a transverse part of any building, which lies across
the main body of the edifice. In churches, a transept is an area set
crosswise to the nave in a cruciform building within the Romanesque and
Gothic Christian church architectural traditions. The transepts cross
the nave at the crossing. The transept of a church separates the nave
from the sanctuary, apse, choir, presbytery, or chancel (i.e. separating
the clergy from the congregation).</p>
<h2 id="crossing">Crossing</h2>
<p>The point where the chancel, nave, and transepts meet. The crossing
junction often involves an elaborate system of arches, as each arm of
the church must be supported where it meets the others.</p>
<h2 id="chapels-and-chantry-chapels">Chapels and Chantry Chapels</h2>
<h3 id="chapels">Chapels</h3>
<p>The term chapel came to be used for sanctuaries where Holy Relics
were preserved and where prayers were said. The term was also used for
sacred buildings with a status less than that of a church.</p>
<h3 id="chantry-chapels">Chantry Chapels</h3>
<p>By the 15th century most large churches had at least one chantry
chapel, in which a priest was employed to sing masses for the soul of
the founder of the chapel and others nominated by him. In town churches
chantry chapels were often supported by trade guilds for the benefit of
their members. Chantry chapels were abolished at the time of the
Reformation.</p>
<h2 id="chancel">Chancel</h2>
<p>Chancel derives from the Latin ‘cancelli’, meaning grating or
lattice.</p>
<p>The term is used to describe a presbytery (the body of church elders
and ministers) which is separated from the nave by a rood screen. From
1215, it was considered necessary to enclose the chancel by a screen -
‘to preserve the mystery of the Eucharist’ and to separate the holy part
of the church from the sometimes rowdy secular activities of the
nave.</p>
<h2 id="chancel-arch">Chancel Arch</h2>
<p>The arched opening in the east wall of the nave, providing access to
the chancel. The chancel arch is often decorated with carving, which may
once have been painted.</p>
<h2 id="choir-quire">Choir (Quire)</h2>
<p>A choir, also sometimes called quire, is the area of a church that
provides seating for the clergy and church choir. It is in the western
part of the chancel, between the nave and the sanctuary. In larger
medieval churches it contained choir-stalls, seating aligned with the
side of the church, so at right-angles to the seating for the
congregation in the nave. Smaller medieval churches may not have a choir
in the architectural sense at all.</p>
<h2 id="sanctuary">Sanctuary</h2>
<p>A sanctuary, in its original meaning, is a sacred place, such as a
shrine.</p>
<p>In many Western Christian traditions including Catholic, Lutheran,
Methodist, and Anglican churches, the area around the altar is called
the sanctuary; it is also considered holy because of the belief in the
physical presence of God in the Eucharist, both during the Mass and in
the church tabernacle at other times.</p>
<p>In many churches the architectural term chancel covers the same area
as the sanctuary, and either term may be used. In some Protestant
churches, the term sanctuary denotes the entire worship space while the
term chancel refers only to the area around the altar-table.</p>
<p>In many Western traditions, altar rails and sometimes steps would
demarcate the sanctuary or chancel from the rest of the building.</p>
<p>The terminology that applies the word sanctuary to the area around
the altar does not apply to Christian churches alone: King Solomon’s
temple, built in about 950 BC, had a sanctuary (‘Holy of Holies’) where
the Ark of the Covenant was, and the term applies to the corresponding
part of any house of worship.</p>
<h2 id="vestry">Vestry</h2>
<p>A vestry is a room in a church in which the vestments are kept, and
in which the clergy and choir don these liturgical clothes for worship
services. Valuable or sacred items such as communion vessels or
collection plates may be kept there, usually in a secure safe, along
with official records such as registers of marriages and burials.</p>
<h2 id="apse">Apse</h2>
<p>An apse (plural apses; from Latin absis ‘arch, vault’ from Greek
apsis ‘arch’; sometimes written apsis, plural apsides) is a semicircular
recess covered with a hemispherical vault or semi-dome, also known as an
exedra. In Byzantine, Romanesque, and Gothic Christian church (including
cathedral and abbey) architecture, the term is applied to a
semi-circular or polygonal termination of the main building at the
liturgical east end (where the altar is), regardless of the shape of the
roof, which may be flat, sloping, domed, or hemispherical.</p>
<h2 id="presbytery">Presbytery</h2>
<p>The presbytery is the area of a church building more commonly
referred to as the ‘chancel’ or ‘sanctuary’. The term also refers to the
ruling body in presbyterian churches consisting of the ministers and
representative elders from congregations within a district.</p>
