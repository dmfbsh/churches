<h1 id="architectural-styles">Architectural Styles</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The architectural style of churches throughout the ages has been
influenced by the techniques and technologies available to the
architects of the time, as well as the movements that set the trends in
architecture.</p>
<p>The history of church architecture in England effectively begins in
597 AD, when the monk Augustine of Canterbury became the first
Archbishop of Canterbury. So, any English history prior to that is not
considered, thus the main periods of English history of relevance
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early Medieval / Anglo-Saxon (597–1066)</li>
<li>Medieval / Middle Ages (1066–1485)</li>
<li>Tudors (1485–1603)</li>
<li>Stuarts (1603–1714)</li>
<li>Georgians (1714–1837)</li>
<li>Victorians (1837–1901)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="anglo-saxon-597-1066">Anglo-Saxon (597-1066)</h2>
<p>Early Anglo-Saxon buildings in Britain were generally simple,
constructed mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. The use of
stone for building construction by the Anglo-Saxons was unusual before
c. 950 AD, but there are exceptions. Thus many Anglo-Saxon churches were
made of wood and so no longer survive; they were generally replaced with
stone constructions after the Norman conquest of Britain.</p>
<p>However, some places of worship were built in stone, these were often
‘minster’ - or monastic - churches that have over time become parish
churches. Anglo-Saxon churches had a simple plan comprising a
rectangular nave adjoining a rectangular chancel.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons were not great stonemasons, they applied the same
techniques used for wood construction to stone. For example, Anglo-Saxon
windows are very distinctive, a triangular-headed one is likely to be
Anglo-Saxon work (it is thought that the design worked well in wood, so
the masons were in effect using planks of stone). Other windows have
round heads and can often be distinguished from Norman windows by
disproportionately large surrounding stones. Or they may have crude
little turned pillars or ‘balusters’ (1) either side.</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon churches are characterised by:</p>
<ul>
<li>semi-circular arches over doors and windows or triangular-headed
doorways and windows</li>
<li>tall and narrow doorways</li>
<li>windows that have small external openings but are deeply splayed
through to the inside</li>
<li>walls that are no more than 90cm thick</li>
<li>strip-work on wall surfaces</li>
<li>herringbone style stonework can be found in the late Saxon/early
Norman buildings</li>
<li>long-and-short quoins (2) (large, tall upright stones alternating
with broad flat stones)</li>
</ul>
<p>Christian churches have been present in Shropshire since the
Anglo-Saxon era, an unknown number were built during this time. Very few
surviving churches have retained Saxon features, the best example being
St Giles, Barrow - founded on the estates of one of England’s earliest
monasteries, Wenlock Abbey (later Priory), probably in the 8th Century
it was used as a small stone oratory, or ‘cell’, for solitary
prayer.</p>

precise date of its foundation is uncertain (thought to be 5th or 6th
Century).</p>

- it is one of about 20 churches in Shropshire mentioned in the Domesday
book and therefore of known Saxon origin.</p>

<p><em>1: The term ‘baluster shaft’ is given to the shaft dividing a
window in Anglo-Saxon architecture.</em></p>
<p><em>2: A quoin is both the external angle or corner of a building
and, more often, one of the stones used to form that angle. These
cornerstones are both decorative and structural, since they usually
differ in jointing, colour, texture, or size from the masonry of the
adjoining walls.</em></p>
<h2 id="norman-1066-1160">Norman (1066-1160)</h2>
<p>Also known as English Romanesque architecture, the Normans were
primarily responsible for introducing this style of architecture
following the conquest of Britain. The change did not happen
immediately, however, and so buildings from the last 30 years of the
11th Century show Saxon and Norman influence. From 1100 AD the Saxon
influence ceased to exist in buildings.</p>
<p>The Norman arch is the defining feature of Norman architecture.
Norman arches are semi-circular. Early examples have plain, square
edges; later ones are often enriched with the zig-zag and roll mouldings
(3). The arches are supported on massive columns, generally plain and
cylindrical, sometimes with spiral decoration; occasionally,
square-section piers were used. Main doorways have a succession of
receding semi-circular arches, often decorated with mouldings, typically
of chevron or zig-zag design; sometimes there is a tympanum (4) at the
back of the head of the arch, which may feature sculpture representing a
Biblical scene.</p>
<p>Norman windows are mostly small and narrow, generally of a single
round-headed light; but sometimes, especially in a bell tower, divided
by a shaft into two lights.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of Norman architecture are:</p>
<ul>
<li>best described as powerful and masculine</li>
<li>defined by semi-circular arches</li>
<li>deeply recessed doorways</li>
<li>thick walls</li>
<li>massive round pillars</li>
<li>vaulted ceilings</li>
<li>ornaments such as zigzag moulding and bird and animal forms</li>
</ul>
<p>In Shropshire, most medieval churches date from the 12th or 13th
Centuries, i.e. they are Norman, Transitional (see below) or Early
English Gothic (see below). A growing population in the 12th and 13th
Centuries meant that some existing churches were extended (typically,
laterally by adding arcades).</p>
<p>Holy Trinity, Much Wenlock, the chancel and nave are Norman and the
tower is Transitional.</p>

<p><em>3: A molding, also spelled moulding, in architecture and the
decorative arts, is a defining, transitional, or terminal element that
contours or outlines the edges and surfaces on a projection or cavity,
such as a cornice, architrave, capital, arch, base, or jamb.</em></p>
<p><em>4: A tympanum, plural tympana, in Classical architecture, is the
area enclosed by a pediment (5), whether triangular or segmental. In a
triangular pediment, the area is defined by the horizontal cornice along
the bottom and by the raking (sloping) cornice along the sides; in a
segmental pediment, the sides have segmental cornices.</em></p>
<p><em>5: A pediment, in architecture, is triangular gable forming the
end of the roof slope over a portico (the area, with a roof supported by
columns, leading to the entrance of a building); or a similar form used
decoratively over a doorway or window.</em></p>
<h2 id="transitional-1160-1200">Transitional (1160-1200)</h2>
<p>The term Transitional is used to denote the merging of one style with
another, especially the 12th Century transition from Romanesque to
Gothic.</p>
<p>St Mary, Bitterley is one of Shropshire’s churches that dates from
the Transitional period and St Michael, High Ercall, is another
example.</p>

<h2 id="gothic-c.-1200---c.-1550">Gothic (c. 1200 - c. 1550)</h2>
<p>The Gothic period breaks down into three periods.</p>
<h3 id="early-english-c.-1200---c.-1300">Early English – c. 1200 -
c. 1300</h3>
<p>The Normans had introduced the three classical orders of architecture
(Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian), and created massive walls for their
buildings, with thin pilaster-like buttresses. The transition from
Norman to Gothic lasted from about 1145 until 1190, the style changed
from the massive Norman style to the more delicate and refined Gothic.
The Gothic style was also introduced from France.</p>
<p>The most distinctive element of this period was the pointed arch,
also known as the lancet arch, which was the key feature of the rib
vault (the skeleton of arches or ribs on which masonry was laid to form
a ceiling or roof). The original purpose of the rib vault was to allow a
heavier stone ceiling, to replace the wooden roofs of the earlier Norman
churches, which frequently caught fire. Rib vaults also had the benefit
of allowing the construction of higher and thinner walls. Gradually,
pointed arches were used not only for rib vaults, but also for all of
the arcades and for lancet windows, giving the nave its unified
appearance.</p>
<p>The Early English rib vaults were usually quadripartite, i.e. each
vault had four compartments divided by ribs, with each covering one bay
of the ceiling (a vault is a structural member consisting of an
arrangement of arches, usually forming a ceiling or roof). The
horizontal ridge ribs intersected the summits of the cross ribs and
diagonal ribs, and carried the weight outwards and downwards to pillars
or columns of the triforium (6) and arcades, and, in later
constructions, outside the walls to the buttresses (7).</p>
<p>The buttress was another important innovation introduced in this
period, a stone column outside the structure that reinforced the walls
against the weight pressing outward and downward from the vaults. This
evolved into the flying buttress, which carried the thrust from the wall
of the nave over the roof of the aisle. The buttress was given further
support by a heavy stone pinnacle.</p>
<p>Early English architecture is also typified by lancet windows, tall
narrow lights topped by a pointed arch (Early English Gothic is
sometimes known as the Lancet style). They were oftren grouped together
side by side under a single arch and decorated with mullions (8) in
tracery (9) patterns, such as cusps, or spear-points.</p>
<p>Stained glass windows began to be widely used in the windows of the
clerestory, transept and especially the west facade.</p>
<p>Unlike the more sombre and heavy Norman churches, the Gothic churches
began to have elaborate sculptural decoration. The arches of the arcades
and triforium were sometimes decorated with dog tooth patterns, cusps,
carved circles, and with trefoils (12), quatrefoils (13), as well as
floral and vegetal designs. Simple floral motifs also often appeared on
the capitals (11), the spandrels (10) and the roof bosses that joined
the ribs of the vaults.</p>
<p>Also, instead of being massive, solid pillars, early Gothic columns
were often composed of clusters of slender, detached shafts, which
descended from the vaults above.</p>
<p>In Shropshire, most medieval churches date from the 12th or 13th
Centuries.</p>
<p>St Mary, Acton Burnell, is considered to be the finest Early English
church in Shropshire (as unlike most English parish churches it is built
in the one style). At St Peter, Cound, the nave, chancel arch and south
aisle are Early English.</p>

<p><em>6: A triforium is an interior gallery, opening onto the tall
central space of a building at an upper level. In a church, it opens
onto the nave from above the side aisles; it may occur at the level of
the clerestory windows, or it may be located as a separate level below
the clerestory.</em></p>
<p><em>7: A buttress is an architectural structure built against or
projecting from a wall which serves to support or reinforce the
wall.</em></p>
<p><em>8: A mullion is a vertical element that forms a division between
units of a window or screen, or is used decoratively. When dividing
adjacent window units its primary purpose is a rigid support to the
glazing of the window. Its secondary purpose is to provide structural
support to an arch or lintel above the window opening.</em></p>
<p><em>9: Tracery is an architectural device by which windows (or
screens, panels, and vaults) are divided into sections of various
proportions by stone bars or ribs of moulding. Most commonly, it refers
to the stonework elements that support the glass in a window. The term
probably derives from the tracing floors on which the complex patterns
of windows were laid out in late Gothic architecture. Tracery can also
be found on the interior of buildings and the exterior.</em></p>
<p><em>10: A spandrel is a roughly triangular space, usually found in
pairs, between the top of an arch and a rectangular frame; between the
tops of two adjacent arches or one of the four spaces between a circle
within a square. They are frequently filled with decorative
elements.</em></p>
<p><em>11: A capital is the crowning member of a column, pier, anta,
pilaster, or other columnar form, providing a structural support for the
horizontal member or arch above. In the Classical styles, the capital is
the architectural member that most readily distinguishes the
order.</em></p>
<p><em>12: A trefoil (from the Latin trifolium, ‘three-leaved plant’) is
a graphic form composed of the outline of three overlapping rings, used
in architecture and Christian symbolism, among other areas.</em></p>
<p><em>13: A quatrefoil is a decorative element consisting of a
symmetrical shape which forms the overall outline of four partially
overlapping circles of the same diameter. It is found in art,
architecture, heraldry and traditional Christian symbolism. The word
‘quatrefoil’ means ‘four leaves’, from the Latin quattuor, ‘four’, plus
folium, ‘leaf’.</em></p>
<h3 id="decorated-c.-1300---c.-1350">Decorated – c. 1300 - c. 1350</h3>
<p>The second style of English Gothic architecture is generally termed
Decorated Gothic, because the amount of ornament and decoration
increased dramatically. It was a period of growing prosperity in
England, and this was expressed in the decoration of Gothic buildings.
Almost every feature of the interiors and facades was decorated.</p>
<p>Lierne Vaulting (14) became much more elaborate in this period. The
rib vault of Early English usually had just four compartments, with a
minimum number of ribs which were all connected to the columns below,
and all played a role in distributing the weight and outwards and
downwards. In the Decorated architecture period, additional ribs were
added to the vaulted ceilings which were purely decorative. They created
very elaborate star patterns and other geometric designs. An even more
elaborate form - fan vaulting, appeared late in the Decorative period,
unlike the lierne vault, the fan vault had no functional ribs; the
visible ‘ribs’ are mouldings on the masonry imitating ribs. The
structure is instead composed of slabs of stone joined together into
half-cones.</p>
<p>The buttress became more common in this period, also; these are the
stone columns outside the walls which supports them, allowing thinner
and higher walls between the buttresses, and larger windows. The
buttresses were often topped by ornamental stone pinnacles to give them
greater weight.</p>
<p>However, Decorated architecture is particularly characterised by the
elaborate tracery within the stained glass windows. The elaborate
windows are subdivided by closely spaced parallel mullions (vertical
bars of stone), usually up to the level at which the arched top of the
window begins. The mullions then branch out and cross, intersecting to
fill the top part of the window with a mesh of elaborate patterns called
tracery, typically including trefoils and quatrefoils. The style was
geometrical at first and curvilinear, or curving and serpentine, in the
later period, This curvilinear element was introduced in the first
quarter of the 14th century and lasted about fifty years.</p>
<p>There are relatively few Decorated or Perpendicular churches in
Shropshire, as the pace of building churches slowed down during the 14th
and 15th Centuries. However, many existing churches were extended during
this time, in particular, many towers were are added or made taller. The
nave and chancel at St Peter, Chelmarsh, are Decorated.</p>

<p><em>14: A lierne is a tertiary rib connecting one rib to another, as
opposed to connecting to a springer, or to the central boss. The
resulting construction is called a lierne vault or stellar vault (named
after the star shape generated by connecting liernes). The term lierne
comes from the French lier (to bind).</em></p>
<h3 id="perpendicular-1350-1550">Perpendicular – 1350-1550</h3>
<p>The Perpendicular style emerged in the mid-14th Century, it is
characterised by an emphasis on vertical lines. The intricate shapes of
the Decorated style gave way to more regular and rectangular shapes.</p>
<p>Walls were built much higher than in earlier periods. Windows became
very large, sometimes of immense size, with slimmer stone mullions than
in earlier periods, allowing greater scope for stained glass craftsmen.
The mullions of the windows are carried vertically up into the arch
moulding of the windows, and the upper portion is subdivided by
additional mullions (supermullions) and transoms (15), forming
rectangular compartments, known as panel tracery.</p>
<p>The interiors of Perpendicular churches were filled with lavish
ornamental woodwork, including misericords, under which were grotesque
carvings; stylized ‘poppy heads’; and elaborate multicoloured
decoration, usually in floral patterns, on panels or cornices
(brattishing (16)). Tracery designs were replaced by more geometric
forms and perpendicular lines.</p>
<p>The Black Death affected the Perpendical style as arts and culture,
took a more sober direction.</p>
<p>Towers were an important feature of the Perpendicular style, though
fewer spires were built than in earlier periods. Decorative Battlements
were a popular decoration of towers in smaller churches.</p>
<p>Doorways were frequently enclosed within a square head over the arch
mouldings, the spandrels being filled with quatrefoils or tracery.
Pointed arches were still used throughout the period, but ogee (17) and
four-centred Tudor arches (18) were also introduced.</p>
<p>Inside the church the triforium disappeared, or its place was filled
with panelling, and greater importance was given to the clerestory
windows, which often were the finest features in the churches of this
period. The mouldings were flatter than those of the earlier periods,
and one of the chief characteristics is the introduction of large
elliptical hollows.</p>
<p>In Shropshire in the 14th Century there were very few new churches,
the implication being that Shropshire remained relatively poor with a
static population and so there was no need for any new churches. The two
notable churches built during this time in the Perpendicular style are
St Laurence, Ludlow (superficially the church is Perpendicular, but
there are significant Decorated elements) and St Peter, Edgmond (the
chancel is Decorated and the tower, porch, nave and aisles are
Perpendicular).</p>

<p><em>15: A transom is a transverse horizontal structural beam or bar,
or a crosspiece separating a door from a window above it. This contrasts
with a mullion, a vertical structural member.</em></p>
<p><em>16: Brattishing or brandishing is a decorative cresting which is
found at the top of a cornice or screen, panel or parapet. The design
often includes leaves or flowers, and the term is particularly
associated with Tudor architecture.</em></p>
<p><em>17: An ogee is the name given to objects, elements, and curves
that have been variously described as serpentine, extended S  or
sigmoid-shaped. Ogees consist of a ‘double curve’, and are the
combination of two semicircular curves or arcs that, as a result of a
point of inflection move from concave to convex or vice versa,  the ends

<p><em>18: A Tudor arch is a four-centered arch which is a low, wide
type of arch with a pointed apex. Its structure is achieved by drafting
two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small radius,
and then turning into two arches with a wide radius and much lower
springing point.</em></p>
<h2 id="th-and-17th-century-tudor-and-stuart">16th and 17th Century
(Tudor and Stuart)</h2>
<p>The building of churches across England came to an abrupt halt at the
end of the reformation (16th Century). During the reign of Elizabeth I
the only church construction in Shropshire was the rebuld of the chancel
at St James, Shipton and the build of the puritan chapel at Langley
(dated either 1564 or 1601).</p>

<p>In the 17th Century, a small number of churches were built (or
rebuilt or otherwise repaired after the Civil War) in Shropshire, but
these were done in the Gothic style, despite the fact that there was a
move to the classical style (being led by Inigo Jones).</p>
<p>St John the Baptist, Stokesay, was destroyed during the English Civil
War; the current church is a rare example of a church extensively
rebuilt during the Puritan period (1654) although some Norman features
survive.</p>

<p>St Bartholomew, Benthall, originally was a chapel which was destroyed
in the Civil War - the present church was built to replace it. The
church is considered to be a fine example of a restoration era (the post
Civil War Stuart period) church.</p>

<p>The Jacobean style is the second phase of Renaissance architecture in
England, which followed the Elizabethan style. It is named after King
James I of England, with whose reign (1603–1625 in England) it is
associated. At the start of James’ reign there was little stylistic
change in architecture, as Elizabethan trends continued. However, James’
death in 1625 coincided with a decisive change towards more classical
architecture, with Italian influence, which was led by Inigo Jones. The
style is sometimes called Stuart architecture, or English Baroque.</p>
<p>In 1689, Holy Trinity, Minsterley was the first church in Shropshire
to be built on classical lines (and the first in the county to be built
of brick).</p>

<h2 id="th-century-georgian">18th Century (Georgian)</h2>
<p>Several new churches were built in Shropshire in the 18th Century,
these churches were built for Protestant worship (which puts more
emphasis on the preaching of the Word and less on the sacraments and so
chancels were made smaller). During this period, many of the village
churches were built of brick with stone dressings. In some cases a
Georgian tower was added to a medieval church.</p>
<p>Georgian architecture is characterised by proportion and balance, it
was based on the symmetry and proportion of the classical architecture
of Greece and Rome.</p>
<p>Anglican churches that were built in the Georgian era were designed
internally to allow maximum audibility, and visibility, for preaching,
so the main nave was generally wider and shorter than in medieval plans,
and often there were no side-aisles. Galleries were common in new
churches. The external appearance generally retained the familiar
signifiers of a Gothic church, with a tower or spire, a large west front
with one or more doors, and very large windows along the nave, but all
with any ornament drawn from the classical vocabulary.</p>
<p>Where funds permitted, a classical temple portico with columns and a
pediment might be used at the west front. Interior decoration was
generally simple or restrained; however, walls often became lined with
plaques and monuments to the more prosperous members of the
congregation.</p>
<p>Some example of Georgian churches in Shropshire are: St Alkmund,
Whitchurch, St Catherine, Eyton-upon-the-Weald-Moors, St Laurence,
Preston-upon-the-Weald-Moors.</p>

<p>Georgian architecture was unpopular in the 19th Century, consequently
the Victorian restorers often drastically altered the character of the
buildings. Also, chancels were often extended or rebuilt after the
High-Church revival to reflect the increased emphasis on the ‘correct’
administration of the sacraments.</p>
<h2 id="the-greek-revival-c.-1790---1836">The Greek Revival (c. 1790 -
1836)</h2>
<p>The Greek Revival was championed in England by two young architects
following a visit to Athens (then part of the Ottoman empire) for the
study of Greek architecture.</p>
<p>A small number of churches were build during this period in
Shropshire, the most notable ones being All Saints, Wellington, St Chad,
Shrewsbury, St Mary Magdalene, Bridgnorth and St Michael, Madeley (the
former two by James Stuart, one of the young architects who visited
Athens, and the latter two by Thomas Telford).</p>

<h2 id="th-century-the-gothic-revival-victorian">19th Century (The
Gothic Revival &amp; Victorian)</h2>
<p>The Gothic Revival was actually underway before Queen Victoria’s
reign, the first church to be built under this movement was St Alkmund,
Shrewsbury (the church was demolished and rebuilt, but the existing
tower and spire retained). Only two other churches were build in
Shropshire in the 19th Century prior to the Victorian era, one is now
closed and the other is St George, Pontesbury (the tower and nave were
rebuilt in the Early English style following the collapse of the
original tower).</p>

<p>In the early 19th Century the Church was at a low ebb, there was
social unrest and dissent, brought on the Napoleonic Wars and the
industrialisation that was happening at the time. The Methodists moved
away from the Church of England and established their own organisation.
As a result in 1818, the Church founded the Church Building Society and
in the same year Parliament passed the Church Building Act. This
provided significant money for new churches to be built. At the same
time, architects were looking back at medieval Gothic architecture, and
under Augustus Pugin, a revolution in this style was established.</p>
<p>Consequently, during Victoria’s reign, nearly every Anglican church
was built in the Gothic style. Also, there was an explosion of church
building in Shropshire on a scale not seen since the 12th Century.</p>
<p>Between 1830 and 1849, 33 churches were built, mostly in the
(relatively plain) Early English style, a few in the neo-Norman
(emulates works of the 11th and 12th century Romanesque in Britain and
Norman France) style (Grinshill, All Saints, 1839-1840 is a good example
of this) and a few in the disappearing Classical style. The churches
were mostly by local architects, the most prolific of these was Edward
Haycock snr, who was responsible for about 13 churches, the best of
which are Cressage (Christ Church, 1841) and Dorrington (St Edward,
1845). Arguably the finest church of the 1840s is Broseley (All Saints,
1845), which, unusually for this time, is built in the Perpendicular
style.</p>

<p>In the mid-Victorian era (c. 1850 to 1879), church design in
Shropshire caught up with the more ambitious designs of the Decorated
style already established and being used in London and elsewhere. During
this time, 44 churches were built in Shropshire, of which 26 were in the
Decorated style, most of the rest were in the Early English style (which
was passing out of fashion) and just 2 were in the Perpendicular style.
Many more of Shropshire’s churches in the mid-Victorian era were by
architects with national practices. Some churches of note are: Sir
George Gilbert Scott’s church at Welshampton (St Michael and All Angels,
1860s), George Edmund Street’s church at St George’s (considered to be
the outstanding church of the mid-19th Century), George Edmund Street’s
church at Withington (St John the Baptist, 1874) and Sir Arthur
Blomfield’s church at Jackfield (St Mary, 1863). Several regional
architects created churches of note also, one example being Edward
Haycock jnr’s church at Meole Brace (Holy Trinity, 1867 to 1868).</p>

<p>Church building in Shropshire slowed down in the last 20 years of the
Victorian era; the last to be built in Shropshire in the 19th Century
was All Saints, Richard’s Castle (Batchcott). Although this church is
Gothic, it does not adhere to any particular medieval period, there are
elements of the Decorated and Perpendicular styles in this church.</p>

<h2 id="th-century">20th Century</h2>
<p>Church building in Shropshire continued in the 20th Century, but at a
much reduced rate. Throughout the Century, designs became contemporary
and modern.</p>
<p>The first churches to be built after the Victorian era were St
Michael, All Stretton (1902) and All Saints, Little Stretton (1903).
These are the final two churches to be included in this project.</p>
